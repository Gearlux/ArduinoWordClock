# NeoWordClock

I started this project when I first saw the [QLockTwo](https://qlocktwo.com/eu/) word clock in a [shop](https://www.lightpoint.be/) while buying the wonderful [Secto Octo 4240](https://www.sectodesign.fi/pendant-lamps/octo-4240-pendant-lamp) lamp.

My girlfriend was also quite impressed, but the price tag kept me from buying the clock. When home, I decided to build a clock myself. Research on the internet led to some kits:
- [Du kansst mitspielen](https://www.du-kannst-mitspielen.com/p/bausatz-303-universal-version-2-3)
- [build-yours.de](https://build-yours.de/product/wordclock-jupiter/)
- [Leuchtbildshop.de](https://www.leuchtbildshop.net/epages/64015097.sf/de_DE/?ObjectPath=Categories)
- [Bastel Laden](https://bastelladen.wortuhr.de/wortuhr-bausatz-42ger-classic.html)

The goal however was to build my own clock. I will try to describe the process here.

The biggest challenge was the electronics. While there are several [DIY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_it_yourself) instructions available
- [Wordclock](https://www.instructables.com/Wordclock/)
- [ArduinoWordClock](https://www.instructables.com/Arduino-Word-Clock/)
this involved a lot of soldering and wires. 

More research led to the [QlockTwo_DIY](https://github.com/jolau/QlockTwo_DIY) github project.
These seemed the most promising project, but I was confused by the schematics

Not knowing anything about Arduino and electronics, I decided to buy the [ELEGOO UNO R3 Super Starter kit](https://www.elegoo.com/collections/uno-r3-starter-kits/products/elegoo-uno-project-super-starter-kit). Not because it was the best, but it was the cheapest kit which was directly available.

With the [Elegoo tuturial](https://www.elegoo.com/blogs/arduino-projects/elegoo-uno-project-super-starter-kit-tutorial), I managed to get myself a little bit familiar with [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) and it's electronics. 
The journey of the word clock can begin ...
